## Hi there, I'm Nana Kofi 👋
As a software engineer, I’m passionate about crafting innovative solutions and captivating designs. I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative flair to every project, aiming to bring your ideas to life

## Career Highlights  
🏥 I’ve developed impactful software solutions that streamline operations and enhance user engagement, particularly in healthcare technology.

🌈 Known for my passion for inclusive tech communities, I foster collaboration and innovation through open-source initiatives.

📈 My projects reflect a commitment to excellence and a drive to push technological boundaries for positive change.

## What programming languages I like

As a frontend developer most of my time I write JavaScript. But in my free time I am trying to build some projects in the backend as well. On serverside I use Node.js most of the time because why don't use javascript on backend? 😎

Java and Python are always fun to code with. Especially when trying to solve algorithm/ds problems 😉
